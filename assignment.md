 # Sequential Life cycle models (LO1)
# Iterative models
Spiral Model 

This model consists of 4 main phases in which the product will go through until it meets the need of the customer. The 4 main phases of the spiral are planning, risk analysis, engineering and finally evaluation. Firstly, in the planning phase you will start to assemble all the requirements you need for the project. The analyst will identify what are the business requirements and what are the system requirements. In this phase there is continual communication between the analyst and the customer to make sure that all the requirements are met correctly. The next phase of this model is risk analysis, this is where the analyst will do some tests to see what kind of risks and errors there could be associated with this project. Additionally in this phase a prototype will be created to allow the analyst to see more errors. The next phase of this spiral is to development and testing of the software. This is to make sure that it works effectively so that it can be shown to the customer. The last phase of the spiral is the evaluation by the customer, they will give the analyst feedback to see how the product can be improved further.


Traditional Agile model

This methodology is used to build software incrementally using short iterations. For example, this model will allow feedback from the customer frequently before they are happy with the final product. The first phase is the requirement analysis, the customer will set requirements and these requirements will be analysed. The next phase of this model is to use the requirements to come up with a design. Also in this phase a prototype is created ready for the testing. The next part is the development phase, the software is tested before being given to the customer for feedback. The customer’s feedback could be things that they would like to be adjusted and improved further. The customer might set new requirements which will have to be added in the next iteration. The next phase is quality assurance. This is where you will identify the defects or issues that were brought up by the customer. Lastly, deployment is the final part of this model, the software is ready for release.  









# Sequential models
Waterfall Model

Every phase will need to go under a review and need to be signed off before moving onto the next part of the model. The first step in this model is the requirement analysis. The requirements are taken in from the customer, they are then analysed and document is created where all the requirements can be seen.  A Review of these documents will then happen, if successful the document will be signed off and the project moves in to the next phase. The next phase of the sequence is the system design. A team will use the requirements documentation to create blueprint for the software. For example, what services and programming languages to use, this will all be put down in a design specification.  Again a review will take place and if everyone is happy it will move on to the next phase. The next part is implementation. Now the developers will look at the design and turn it into code. There will make sure that the code meets all the requirements that were set in the previous phases. The second to last part is the testing of the code. In this phase the code is tested thoroughly to see if there are any issues with the software. The last part of this model is the operation and maintenance phase. The software is ready to functional and ready to use. In this part it is not just about the software being operational but also being maintained, this is so that updates or changes can be made. 


Throw away Prototyping

The way in which throw away prototyping works is by first establishing the requirements. From this we can tell what the customer needs from the software. For example, what the software should do and what the target audience is. After, the requirements are looked at in detail and a prototype is created. Now that the prototype is completed it will be given to the customer to test and evaluate. The customer will give feedback and the prototype will be thrown away. However, the review which is given is very important. If the review which is received is good and the customer is happy, the things which were included in the prototype can now be added into the development of the main system. If not a new prototype should be created.   





# Risk Management in Spiral model 

There are many ways in which risk is managed in the spiral model. Firstly, the spiral goes through the planning stage, this is where all the requirements are gathered to make sure the team know what is needed to be done.  In the spiral risk analysis is a very important phase. Here the risks of the project are broken down and analysed thoroughly. In this part of the model the risks will be identified, then the analyst will think about how to reduce the risk or trying to remove the risk altogether. Another way risk is managed is by creating a prototype, a prototype will give an in depth look of feel of the project. This will further reduce the risk because if it is not up to standard more tests and analysis can be done. In a spiral model the process goes through each phase multiple times.  In this cycle the customer will be able to see the software while it is still in production. This means that if they would like change this is easily possible because the product hasn’t been finished yet.

# Why a lifecycle model is selected 

The example that I am using is the game I am creating which is called tracker ball. A player will control one square which the mouse while an AI will control the other square. The aim is to keep the player’s square away from the AI’s square.
The methodology which I think is best to use is the spiral model. 
There are many reasons why this model is selected for this project. Firstly, intense planning is done to make sure the team get the right requirements and tools for this project. In this example it will be helpful because the team can find out the main things that they need to put into the game to meet the needs of the client. How big they need both squares to be and what is the speed the game square moves at are just some things they can find out.
Another reason why this model is selected is because it uses prototyping really well. This is because it is not only done once but multiple times. This is really beneficial because after development and testing the client will be able to see a design really early. This can help the team because they can get feedback from the client. In this case a first draft of the tracker ball was created, it went through some testing and was given to the client. The client can then judge the game to see if they are happy with it and what improvements they would like from the next prototype. 
Iterations of the design happen again and again which massively reduces the risk of failure and this is what makes this a great methodology. 




 # Purpose of a feasibility report (LO2)

This is a study to see how successful an idea could be. This is a study to access whether to go ahead with the project or not. There are many reasons why a business will do a feasibility study. A feasibility report gives a broad focus to the project and also helps to see what the alternatives are. For example a game developer might decide to build a shooting game, but from the feasibility report soon realised that this isn’t the current trend and will look at a different game to build. Another reason why a company will do this study is to find out who the competition are, from this the team can understand how to make their project different or how to improve what is already in the market. Feasibility reports are done to see if the project is financially viable. Here the team can see if a return will be made on the investment. An analysis will be done to see if the revenue will be more than the start-up costs. Lastly, a feasibility report can help receive funding from banks or money lending companies. If they can see the project has a good chance of succeeding, the company will more likely give you the money.  

# How can technical solutions be compared

Technical solutions can be compared in many different ways. 
Firstly, the time taken for a solution to be put in place, from this an analysis can be done to see how long each solution will take. The team can then can go for the best option, this preferably will be the one that will be the quickest.									   
The next technical solution that can be compared is the skills needed to help solve the problem.	         
How difficult it is to solve the problem, how hard it is to put the solution in place.
Lastly, how effective the solution is. Does it repair the problem fully or are smaller problems create
				
# Components of a feasibility report

Market Feasibility 


In this part the team will find out what is in the current market, from this they can evaluate if similar products are popular or there is a gap in the market for what they would like to develop. In this part of the study they can also evaluate their completion. They can see their strengths and weaknesses and use it to their own advantage by improving their own product. Another reason why market feasibility is done is to see who might buy the product. Understanding who the potential buyers are is important because the team can tailor the experience to their needs. For example, they might say how they would like the software to run, look and feel. You could then use this information and integrate into the planning of the product.


Technical Feasibility 


In this part the company will find out the type of equipment and technology that is required to develop the product. For example, a software company will find out what operating system and what programming language is best to use. Other things that can be identified is who are the potential suppliers, what services and guarantees are given and how long it will take to obtain the equipment and start the work. From looking at many different suppliers the company can see which supplier is the best for their business. 


Financial Feasibility
Here the company will look at the total start-up costs that are needed to begin the project. They will look at the equipment costs, the legal costs and accounting costs. Other costs include the running costs, these take into account wages, rent, utilities and any interest payments the company may have. Other aspect the company will look into is the potential revenue that could be obtained, this could be based on demand and this can help with pricing strategies. The company can also see who the potential lenders are and what the terms and conditions for borrowing are. From looking at all these costs the company can see if a return will be made from the investment. This can determine whether the company should go ahead with the project. 

Organisational Feasibility


This part of the study looks at the legal structure of the company, this could include a professional background information about the people who own the company and what skills they can bring.


Conclusions  

This part of feasibility will look at the report as a whole, this will sum up the feasibility report to see if it worth going ahead with the product or application.

# How software requirements can be traced throughout the software lifecycle

Traceability of requirements is finding out why a requirement is brought up, it is the idea of explaining how the requirement came into existence. Traceability also helps in understanding why and how a specific system addresses the needs of the stakeholder. 
Traceability is utilised to trace the connection between a requirement and its source. For instance, a requirement may follow from a company requirement, a client request, a rule that the company has set, an outer interface specification or to some other source. Additionally, traceability can be used to trace requirements to other work products. For example, a requirement might trail to a piece of code, a design or a documentation of the product that the client has written. A good way of using traceability is by take into account bidirectional traceability, this means that the traceability chain can be followed both in a forwards and backwards motion. 
An example of this is if a solution is being produced utilising the Microsoft Solution Framework display, Microsoft gives an ALM device named 'Microsoft Visual Studio Team Suite'. Using traceability, a thorough perspective will be given of the requirement in the solution. 
A regular task engaged in this skill is recognising the correct device for dealing with this solution. This should reinforce initiating the bi-direction traceability between the many items created during the life cycle at all the stages. 
By undertaking traceability in the right manner it gives a timely perspective of the current condition of the solution under progress and along these lines enables to look at the stability of the solution. It gives contributions to the stakeholders regarding triple requirements, Resource, Schedule, and Scope. 
One of the day to day exercises during the lifecycle is to create a forward and backward traceability report for the project. This tool which is used should enhance giving the answer to encourage a comprehension of the current condition of the project.

# Two approaches of improving software quality


Two methods which are great for improving software are testing early and often with automation and also integrate quality controls from the beginning.
To make the quality of software better it is vital that tests happen early and as often as possible. Testing a piece of software early will make certain that issues and problems will not grow larger into more complex issues. Generally, by waiting and testing later the issue could become bigger. If the issue becomes greater, it will become more costly to fix and more time consuming as well.
Testing regularly will need an emphasis on early integration of the correct automated testing discipline. Begin by automating non UI test first then gradually allow the inclusion to UI based tests when the product has settled. In certain situations a company uses web-services/ API’s, here the tests will be automated to make sure that all the guidelines and logic are tried. 
At different stages an error can cost more to resolve. For example an error that costs £100 pound to fix in the requirements stage could cost £10,000 in the design stage and £100,000 in the implementation stage.
Another approach to improving software quality is by including quality controls from the start. This is vital because the different set of teams will know what the standards are for this project. The testers can assess the quality controls and build awareness in the organisation with engineers to guarantee standards are constantly being met. Quality controls begin early and happen throughout the process.  
A very good connection among the testers and engineers can assist the undertaking of the programming methodology to grow adequately. A technique in quality control can ensure that coding mistakes and bugs are managed properly, following an organised procedure.

# Two software behavioural specification methods

Software behavioural specification methods

An activity diagram is used to show the flow of control in a framework and consults to the steps which are included in the implementation of the use case.  Activity diagrams show sequential and simultaneous tasks, meaning that it can either show a flow of information in a sequence or show a flow of information where many different tasks could happen at the same time. This diagram centres on the state of movement and the arrangement in which it occurs. This diagram shows the control from a beginning to an end point illustrating the many decision paths that exist while the action is being enforced. This is a chart which is utilised in business and process modelling where the main use is to show the dynamic parts of a system. Unified modelling language (UML) come in three types, structure diagrams, interaction diagrams, and behaviour diagrams. This diagram is behavioural diagram meaning it shows the behaviour of a system. Below is an example of an activity diagram:
![Chart]( https://i.imgur.com/5ddeMdc.png)

A state chart diagram illustrates the many different states of a component in a system. These states are influenced by events which can happen either internally or externally. This chart illustrates the movement of control from one state to another. This particular chart is one of five UML charts which are utilised to show how the system can work. Various states are defined for an object and these events can change when a certain event takes place. This diagram is known as a reactive system because it responds to something happening. Additionally this chart can be utilised for forward and backward engineering but this is mainly used to show the reactive system. 


# Finite state machine and Extended Finite state machine

Finite state machine 


Finite state machine is a computation chart that can be executed with hardware or software and can be used to create sequential logic and some pc programs. It is used to display the control execution flow.  This model can be used to show many problems, for example mathematical problems, artificial intelligence and game applications. The finite state machine is thought to be in a Boolean state. This means the state can either be on or off. An example which can be used to show a state machine is a traffic light. 

An Extended Finite state machine is
